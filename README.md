# ðŸ§  Code Practice

Welcome to my little corner of the internet where I document code problems, solutions, and learning experiments.

## Why I Made This Repository

I'm the type of person who forgets things easily after learning â€” not because I donâ€™t care, but because my brain likes to wander.

To solve that, I created this repository as my personal memory bank.  
A place to:
- Revisit solutions Iâ€™ve written,
- Reflect on my progress over time,
- Practice coding regularly and intentionally,
- Keep my mind sharp, even on sleepy days.

Sometimes the best way to learn is to forget, and then remember *with better understanding*.

## Languages Used

Primarily:
- C++
- GNU Octave
- Matlab
- Python
- Bash (for scripts)
- Markdown (for notes)

## Final Thoughts

This repo isnâ€™t meant to be perfect â€” itâ€™s messy, growing, and honest.  
Just like learning itself.

If you're like me â€” forgetful but curious â€” maybe youâ€™ll find something useful here too.

> *"Forgetfulness is just the mind asking for repetition. Give it what it wants."*
